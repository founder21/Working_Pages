					<h3>Religious Freedom violation in Moldova</h3>
					<h4>Summer 2015</h4>

					<div class="religion__content">
						<p>Republic of Moldova has no state religion although the predominant religion is Orthodox Christianity, a 2007 law on Religious Denominations acknowledges the “special significance and primary role” of the Orthodox Church.All the rest religious organizations must be registered by the state, which can potentially lead to arbitrary and prejudicial decision-making during the registration process. Along with this positive changes to legislation, which has eliminated some of the obstacles religious groups faced with the registration process, religious minorities continue to face discrimination and hostility in Moldovan society.</p>
						<p>Religious tolerance and acceptance of religious diversity is another issue Moldovan society faces. The new religious movements are frequently restricted in their rights by the tacit alliance between the State and the Orthodox Church. Although different religions are free to organize their own education, the Orthodox Church monopolizes religious education in secondary schools. The religion lobby also opposed the initiative to introduce Life Skills-Based Education in schools, since it would destroy the traditional family by promoting “abnormal concepts” such as gender and sexual orientation, drugs.</p>
						<p>By Constitution all religions are recognized and afforded religious freedoms in Moldova. What is humorous is that by interpretation, these “religions” are referred to as “cults” in Moldova. The explication of cult are the followers of an exclusive system of religious beliefs and practices; followers of an unorthodox, extremist, or false religion or sect who often live outside of conventional society under the direction of a charismatic leader.</p>
						<p>There is just one religion which is sanctioned, given special diplomatic status and lots of money. 95-96% of the nation belong to this church, and they claim to be Christian known as the Moldovan Orthodox or Metropolis of Chisinau and all Moldova – part of the Russian Orthodox Church.Priests Rape Children, and the headlines are full of this fact, with more headlines from all around the EU being posted daily. This creepy-looking, long-beard-wearing old Russian is named Vladimir Mikhailovich Gundyayev referred to as Patriarch Kirill I or Cyril I Here is what this cult’s leader says about the Priests who rape children: Nothing! He stands mute and is really good friends with Pope Benedict, youth nazi. So, for him it is all political and money making time all day, every day. So there you have it, he hates Jews but loves pedophiles, but pretends to hate fags. Jews – Prior to WWII there were a lot of Jews in Moldova. However, there are only 12,000 Jews in the former Soviet Republic today – 20 years ago there were 66,000 Jews. Many immigrated to Israel.</p>
						<p>In Transnistria, freedom of religion is practically non-existent, in as much as there is an overcomplicated procedure of registration of religious groups, which includes a number of additional requirements. In order to be formally registered, religious groups have to have at least ten members and be active for a minimum of ten years, during which they have limited permission to address the public. Moreover, religious groups can lose their property if they are active without registration. The Transnistria legislation neither complies with international standards, nor guarantees equality for diverse religious groups.</p>
						<p>The Baptist community in Transnistria remains unregistered. In the last years, the Baptists in Transnistria complained of increasing harassment from the authorities although the Baptists reported no direct harassment. In addition authorities did not report threats to destroy the group’s church, and the group continued to meet in the same building.</p>
						<p>In Transnistria, the authorities do not allow religious groups to participate in elections, other political party activity, or to support nongovernmental organizations involved in elections.</p>
						<p>The Moldovan authorities need to seriously consider its international commitments, to fully adopt and start implementing the Freedom of Religion and Belief also respect and fulfill religious freedoms, without discrimination.</p>
