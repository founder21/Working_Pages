					<div class="lessons__body">
						<p>In todayâ€™s global world, the importance of English can not be denied and ignored since English is the most common language spoken everywhere and its well known as an international standard language. In communication, English language become the primary mediator for delivering or sharing information. With the help of developing technology, English has been playing a major role in many sectors including medicine, mass media , social life and education, which, in my opinion, is the most important arena where English is needed.</p>
						<p>I believe that if everyone in the world learnt the same language, such as English then it would be much easier to communicate with people all over the world. We would be able to learn a lot about each other cultures and life experiences as we will not have a language barrier. I also feel that people should continue to learn the English language in order to keep their opportunities open.</p>
						<p>The only effective way of improving someones English is to use it, as often as possible. Here I can give free English lessons about any topics anybody is interested also we can discuss about freedom of speech and freedom of religion from Moldova and any other related topix about the situation in Moldova.</p>
